# Movie HUB - MERN Stack based application

> This web-application is built as a backend project to demonstate the use of REST API in general. It covers following points :-
### 1. I've created a Navbar having three buttons: HOME , SEARCH, POST
![Navbar](./md-utilities/nav.png)
<hr>

### 2. HOME :- This frontend page uses GET api to fetch movies using pagination. Each pagination can hold upto 10 entries.
![Pagination- First page with 10 movies](./md-utilities/pagination.png)
<hr>

### 3. SEARCH :- This page frontend has two parts:- GET movie by :id ; GET all movies at once.
![Get Movue by id](./md-utilities/getById.png)
![Get Movie by id - Single movie at once](./md-utilities/getById2.png)
![All Movies at once- By clicking on "SHOW ALL MOVIES"](./md-utilities/all.png)
<hr>

### 4. POST :- This page uses POST api to add movues into database.
